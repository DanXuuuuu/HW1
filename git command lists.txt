Git clone projectPath: copies a remote repository to the local machine

Git pull -> updates changes from a remote repository into current branch 

Git checkout [branchName] -> moves to the specified branch

Git branch [branchName] -> create a new branch with specific branch name without switching it

Git checkout -b [branchName] -> crete a new branch with specific branch name and switch into it 

Git branch: shows all branches in the repository 

Git add .: stages all modified files for next commits

Git commit: records staged changes in the repository

Git log: shows a log of commits in the branch 

Git Push: sends local changes to the remote branch 

Git merge: combines the specified branch into your current branch 

Git reset vs git revert:
git reset: removes commits or changes from local branch history or working directory
git revert: creates a new commit to undo a previous one without rewriting history 

Git merge vs git rebase 
git merge: combines two branches, keep the history of two branches
git rebase: move one branch to the end of another branch, rewrite history 

Git pull vs git fetch
git pull: combines git fetch and merge. 
git fetch: downloads remote changes but not merge them.
